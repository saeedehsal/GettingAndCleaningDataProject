Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================
This experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within the age bracket of 19-48 years.

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

Out of total 561 feature, we have filetered just mean and std related feture vector and prepared a tidy data set ready for analysis.


The dataset includes the following columns:
=========================================
- subject_id : its volunteer id. it takes value between 1 and 30.

- activity_id : its the activity id changing  between 1 and 6 each of which related to one of the activities.

- activity_type : description for activity_id. this columns takes value between (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

- the rest of the columns are basically mean and std related features that we have measured.
